				Background
			</div>
					bCourses is a Canvas web and mobile application
					used as a platform to connect students and instructors. Students use bCourses to view and submit homework assignments, connect
					 with peers and faculty, and see their personalized grades. I decided to complete this redesign in a 2-week design sprint.
				 <div class = "header">
					 The Problem
				 </div>
				Despite most courses at UC Berkeley being hosted on bCourses, the current interface is painful to use. The app
				leaves users feeling confused and frustrated, namely in its most crucial interactions.

			</div>
	 			A survey of 20 students currently attending UC Berkeley showed the necessity of bCourses, and revealed
				the pain points of the students. The main pain points were the following:
				<ul>
					<li>
						The Jack of All Trades
					</li>
					<li>
						Desire for clarity
					</li>
					<li>
						Connectivity
					</li>
					<li>
						Aesthetic
					</li>
				</ul>

			 <div class = "four-grid">
				 <div class = "grid-item">
					<div class = "grid-header">
						Jack of All Trades
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						Users often showed they were more likely to use bCourses for tasks that were
						mandatory. The majority of users did not use Calendar and Inbox, due to having an
						established application for these purposes.
					</div>
				 </div>

				 <div class = "grid-item">
					<div class = "grid-header">
						Clarity
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						The most common pain point among students was the need for
						 clarity across its crucial functionalities — this included file search,
						  course distinction, and assignment submissions.
					</div>
				 </div>

				 <div class = "grid-item">
					<div class = "grid-header">
						Connectivity
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						Lots of students noted that they did not use the Groups feature,
						but wanted a better way to use the platform to connect with students and faculty in the class.

					</div>
				 </div>

				 <div class = "grid-item">
					<div class = "grid-header">
						Aesthetics
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						Many students noted that bCourses’ UI felt clunky and out-of-date. A major part of the
						 redesign was to align the user interface up to speed with more modern design trends.

				The Solution
			 </div>
			 I narrowed my focus on improving the existing systems that students felt were mandatory for succeeding in their classes(viewing
			 instructor-uploaded content, submitting assigments, and checking grades). These interactions were noted as
			 the most difficult to navigate.

			What Lies Ahead
		</div>
		In the future iterations of this redesign, I would want to explore internal version of taking quizzes and
		add more complex functionality to the file viewing system. I felt that the UI fixes went hand in hand with the usability
		issues themselves, as clarifying the UI allowed for the experience to be clarified in return.
		 Despite this, I would continue to improve the flow of the more minute interactions to not only make it usable, but as delightful
		  of an experience as possible.
		<br><br>

		I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the ways students interact with the software designed to help them succeed in school.
		I learned about the minute, individualized frustrations Berkeley students had with the application and the wider, more general
		 issues students had.
