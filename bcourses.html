					User Research
				</div>
				A survey of 20 students currently attending UC Berkeley showed that students weren't using bCourses
				 beyond the functionalities that enabled students to succeed in their classes(submitting assignments,
				 viewing readings), When diving into the pain points of the students, we discovered some key insights:

				 <div class = "bold">
					Idle Features
				 </div>
				 Users noted they tended to not use features such as calendar and inbox,
				 stating they already had established methods and mediums for carrying out this functionality.
				 <div class = "bold">
					Lack of Clarity
				 </div>
				 Students noted the lack of clarity across the main features of bCourses—
				 this included file search, course distinction, and assignment submissions.
				 <div class = "bold">
					 Building Community
				 </div>
				 ots of students noted that they did not use the Groups feature,
				 but wanted a better way to use the platform to connect with students and faculty in the class.
				 <div class = "bold">
					Aesthetics and Feel
				 </div>
				 Many students noted that bCourses’ UI felt clunky and out-of-date. A major part of the redesign was to align the user interface up to speed with more modern design trends.

					I narrowed my focus on improving the existing systems that students felt were mandatory for

				In the future iterations of this redesign, I would want to explore internal version of taking quizzes and add more complex functionality to the file viewing system. I felt that the UI fixes went hand in hand with the usability issues themselves, as clarifying the UI allowed for the experience to be clarified in return. Despite this, I would continue to improve the flow of the more minute interactions to not only make it usable, but as delightful of an experience as possible.
				<br><br>
				I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the ways students interact with the software designed to help them succeed in school. I learned about the minute, individualized frustrations Berkeley students had with the application and the wider, more general issues students had.
