				Background
			</div>
					bCourses is a Canvas web and mobile application
					used as a platform to connect students and instructors. Students use bCourses to view and submit homework assignments, connect
					 with peers and faculty, and see their personalized grades. I decided to complete this redesign in a 2-week design sprint.
				 <div class = "header">
					 The Problem
				 </div>
				Despite most courses at UC Berkeley being hosted on bCourses, the current interface is painful to use. The app
				leaves users feeling confused and frustrated, namely in its most crucial interactions.
				<div class = "page-image-shadow">
				 <img src = "assets/img/bcourses/old/landing.png">
				 <div class = "grid-caption">
					 Current home view. Action items are pushed to the right and there is lack of course distinction.

			 <div class = "page-image-shadow">

				<div class = "grid-caption">
					Lack of pertinent information regarding assignment submission.

					Survey results of student use cases.
				</div>
			</div>
	 			A survey of 20 students currently attending UC Berkeley showed that students weren't using bcourses beyond the functionalities
				that enabled students to succeed in their classes(submitting assignments, viewing readings), When diving
				into the pain points of the students, we discovered some key insights:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Idle Features
					</li>
					<li>
						Lack of Clarity
					</li>
					<li>
						Building Community
					</li>
					<li>
						Aesthetics and Feel
					</li>
				</ul>

			 <div class = "four-grid">
				 <div class = "grid-item">
					<div class = "grid-header">
						Idle Features
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						Users noted they tended to not use features such as calendar and inbox,
						stating they already had established methods and mediums for carrying out this functionality.
					</div>
				 </div>

				 <div class = "grid-item">
					<div class = "grid-header">
						Lack of Clarity
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						Students noted the lack of clarity
across the main features of
bCourses— this included file search,
course distinction, and assignment
submissions.
					</div>
				 </div>

				 <div class = "grid-item">
					<div class = "grid-header">
						Building Community
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						Lots of students noted that they did
not use the Groups feature, but
wanted a better way to use the
platform to connect with students
and faculty in the class.
					</div>
				 </div>

				 <div class = "grid-item">
					<div class = "grid-header">
						Aesthetics and Feel
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						Many students noted that bCourses’ UI felt clunky and out-of-date. A major part of the
						 redesign was to align the user interface up to speed with more modern design trends.

			 Redesign Goals
			</div>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Streamline</strong> - Increase ease of access and flow of files, assignments, grades, and submission.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Centralize</strong>  - Concentrate pertinent interactions and student priorities into a singular dashboard.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Update</strong>  - Bring site aesthetics up to speed with current visual trends and patterns.
				</li>
			</ol>

			 <div class = "header">
				The Solution
			 </div>
			 I narrowed my focus on improving the existing systems that students felt were mandatory for succeeding in their classes(viewing
			 instructor-uploaded content, submitting assigments, and checking grades). These interactions were noted as
			 the most difficult to navigate.
			 <div class = "page-image-shadow">
				<img src = "assets/img/bcourses/mid/dash.png">
				<div class = "grid-caption">
					Redesigned dashboard view.
				</div>
			</div>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Assignments</strong> - A centralized location for the most recently assigned work.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Courses</strong>  - Easy access and viewing for each course a student is enrolled in.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Updates</strong>  - The most recent announcements in a centralized location.
				</li>
			</ol>

		 <ol>
			 <li>
				 <strong>Visible Search</strong> - File search that appears immediately to the user, as opposed to hidden within the layers of folders.

			 <li>
				 <strong>Folders and Files</strong>  - Folders and files in an more intuitive, GUI, much like Google Drive’s organization.

			What Lies Ahead
		</div>
		In the future iterations of this redesign, I would want to explore internal version of taking quizzes and
		add more complex functionality to the file viewing system. I felt that the UI fixes went hand in hand with the usability
		issues themselves, as clarifying the UI allowed for the experience to be clarified in return.
		 Despite this, I would continue to improve the flow of the more minute interactions to not only make it usable, but as delightful
		  of an experience as possible.
		<br><br>

		I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the ways students interact with the software designed to help them succeed in school.
		I learned about the minute, individualized frustrations Berkeley students had with the application and the wider, more general
		 issues students had.
