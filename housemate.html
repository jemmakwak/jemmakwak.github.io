				As a student at UC Berkeley, accessible and quality housing is often <a class = "text-link" href = "http://www.dailycal.org/2017/11/19/temporary-housing-constant-stress/">very difficult</a>
				 to find. For many students,
				<br><br>
				I narrowed the problems into the following :

				 <ul>
	 				<li>
	 					<b>Poorly conveyed inclusion.</b> While CS KickStart attempts to market itself as inclusionary, there is little to no  no indication that it is for all students who identify as womxn.
	 				</li>
	 				<li>
	 					<b>Unnecessary sub-pages.</b> The sub-pages either consisted of walls of text or very few sentences.
	 				</li>
	 				<li>
	 					<b>Lack of visuals.</b> The site fails to quickly convey their message without walls of text.
	 				</li>
	 			</ul>

				<div class = "page-header titillium">Design Goals</div>
				The mission of CS KickStart is largely echoed in nationwide programs such as Girls Who Code and other computer science education programs aimed toward womxn-identifying individuals.
				<br/><br/>
				I looked to Girls Who Code as a prime reference point of how a website could remain <b>inviting and informative. </b>
				<br/><br/>
				The primary goals of the website redesign became the following:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Improve the user&#39;s speed in understanding how the program is run.
					</li>
					<li>
						Clearly convey the aimed user audience(womxn-identifying) and maintain an inclusive
					</li>
					<li>
						Produce visual assets to improve the visual experience.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class = "page-header titillium">
					Final Mockups
				</div>
					I decided a single-scroll website would be best to showcase all the information any potential
					user would need to understand the program in as little time as possible. These are the
					final mockups of the site flow.
				<div class = "page-header titillium">Visual Assets</div>
				I had a lot of time creating the illustrations on the website.
