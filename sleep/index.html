			<h3 >Sleep is for Everyone</h3>
			<div class = "paragraph">
			<p>
				Contrary to hustle culture&rsquo;s oft celebrated ideal of sacrificing precious sleep time to &#34;get it done,&#34; sleep is not &#34;for the weak.&#34; Sleeping is critical in order to be at your best physical, mental, and emotional state. Most species, including honey bees, engage in some form of sleep!
				Adults should optimally be sleeping around <a href = "https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need">9 hours a night</a>.

			<h3>The All-Nighter</h3>
			<p class = "select">
				Even if you &#34;feel fine&#34; after skipping out on sleep, many studies have actually shown that our subjective feelings of sleepiness often incorrectly predict our objective well-being. In addition, research has shown that our performance of memory recall is directly inhibited by lack of sleep.
				<br /><br />
				Pulling an all-nighter might seem like a good idea in the moment, but there are incredibly drastic consequences. When in doubt, put your health first and sleep on it!

			<h3>The Effects of Sleep Deprivation</h3>
			<p>
				Depriving yourself of sleep has a multitude of consequences on your health.
				<h4>&#128201; Decreased Performance</h4>
				Research shows that our performance, such as procedural skills (our motor and visual abilities) and our declarative memory recall, <a href = "https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/why-all-nighter-can-be-harmful-your-health">decreases as the amount of sleep decreases</a>.
				<h4>&#127917; Emotional Instability</h4>
				Have you noticed that your mood goes back and forth when you&#39;re sleep deprived? Research points to heightened emotional instability when we are sleep deprived. Research also suggest that we experience greater depressive moods the less sleep we get.
				<h4>&#129298; Immune (Mal)Function</h4>
				When we lose valuable hours from even one night of sleep, our immune system function is dramatically reduced. One major effect on our immune system is a loss in the amount of our <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7871104">Natural Killer Cells</a> &mdash; around a 70% decrease. These cells are dedicated to protecting against disease and fighting off cancer. Additionally, our antibody response is reduced, which prevents our ability to successfully build immunity from vaccines.
				<h4>&#127828; Hunger and Cravings</h4>
				Two main hormones operate to regulate our hunger: <a href = "https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/connection-between-sleep-and-overeating#:~:targetText=The%20Connection%20Between%20Sleep%20and%20Overeating&targetText=Two%20hormones%20that%20help%20regulate,to%20an%20increase%20in%20hunger.">leptin and ghrelin</a>. Leptin inhibits our appetite, and ghrelin increases our appetite. When we are sleep deprived, both these hormones become imbalanced &mdash; the amount of leptin decreases while ghrelin increases. Thus, we don&#39;t feel as full when we physiologically should, and we want to eat more when we normally wouldn&#39;t. Not only have studies shown a general increase in food intake*, but an increase in carb-heavy, sugary foods.
				<br /><br />
				*This is not to meant to imply that an increase in food intake is negative, but rather that sleep deprivation often disrupts our natural cycles of eating and consumption, which can negatively impact our health and prevent us from receiving the regular feedback we normally get from our body. No food-shaming or body-shaming is intended! &#9888;

			<h3>Melatonin</h3>
			<p>
				Melatonin is widely accepted as a perfectly normal sleep-inducing pill, but there are some things you should know before taking one before bed. Melatonin acts to regulate our sleep-wake cycles, but research has shown that it doesn&#39;t act as an automatic sleep inducer. If anything, melatonin is as effective as a placebo pill (which is still significant, given that placebo is one of the most powerful pharmaceuticals).
				<br/><br/>
				Because melatonin is not regulated by the FDA, it is technically conisdered a dietary supplement. Thus, the dosage and amount varies widely across different brands. You might get way more melatonin than what is actually suggested.

			<h3>Sleep, Over Time</h3>
			<p>
				The ontogeny, or architecture, of our sleep changes over time. As we grow older, the general amount of sleep we get goes down, the amount of awakenings during the night goes up, and the amount of REM sleep (the type of sleep that is critical for many functions)

			<h3>The Worst Case Scenario</h3>
			<p>
				What happens when you go without sleep for as long as possible? A few decades ago, a radio DJ named <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tripp">Peter Tripp</a> attempted to break the world record for the longest time gone without sleep. He was able to break the world record by going without sleep for eight days, but suffered permanent consequences. Tripp experienced lasting symptoms of pyschosis, hallucinations, and paranoia. Tripp never fully recovered from this experiment and many close to him stated he was not the same person. This record is <a href = "https://www.sciencealert.com/watch-here-s-what-happened-when-a-teenager-stayed-awake-for-11-days-straight">no longer available</a> to &#34;break&#34;, as it has been deemed to dangerous and damaging for those who attempt it.
				<br /><br />
				Total sleep deprivation research has been conducted on rats. The results ultimately, and sadly, <a href = "https://watermark.silverchair.com/120103.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAo8wggKLBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJ8MIICeAIBADCCAnEGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMxYJOyVvWBGAS2p1fAgEQgIICQmu0_1E90KLBIOfocI3u_JsK16tylhVLvxxN0CmelPXzYuf535dtSOfOIbnGNOzv46g_2jYb4isaeqE-MJ1xfAhqAWeRmSPVEYLbhcGW9Im5phFTCMS62rmebOqcDXJ8b0ZKrGnR42TPS2HhGo_lyzGydd6X7Qzn5MH7nvyZdpNCDW_IPn-cahb4pb5B5ii8qzoKCFHokYitb7awXfeezvGUpwp6ByjfvQT9A82VW7SXSOOx8v7ytKvE6vEzYxukHRqnmcOO_06JipwltAixOP5wYcdJVXdgfEcZ4kSZFUfnQKUpCSE9UtNd_X63bNlsLzAOI_Bv_VOVDKRVZ8nJNv9Py_pSwdBxbFWn6sICAkNWsKmC20CGtIM6cwYXmISIGxwTkKZ6RzxUYIgkOrMn7hX3lgw3feX0SY5UnapDizXBk94l7rNKXca3V0e3LXdFytdTVzGwWjUBkzr-_IisAEOAQ4fPuUxmDZvw2p9bc0mwhICRy8WcvRMCIveIqolbB2M8LwTJpelCaHW5FYyDEH-t7oJI4zd0BNI8CUi0SSEDxOGvRhaR7GSchPV6MMrAnMCpoSLBIR_mEBxmiGXeC0XW5p8fE8jgxxouF09xSbKgSHrvUJMdJesMSvcZTDGf81csOpUn0ai-j-q3WZmJ8hzQn-YxInGvWwmBSD2i5EVGqgQmVTbdsU2zWXArbBG1rmyOXRIEF3uz94TmA-nvGslQQMaAU1iJFtmYAMFDUhQT5GIc4YHvQ7drY6FPhLsEIWgZ">lead to death</a> due to complete immune system failure (among a host of other nasty side effects).

			<h3>Parting Thoughts</h3>
			<p>
				Sleep is one of the most critical part of our lives, but it is often one of the first things we deprioritize when we feel we need more time (for whatever reason). To allot ourselves a good amount of sleep (remember, 9 is optimal) is truly one of the best things we can do for ourselves, our health and overall functioning.
