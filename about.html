			Nice to meet ya! I’m currently a junior studying Psychology, Cognitive Science, and Design Innovation
			at UC Berkeley. I recently worked at <a class ="link" id = "a" href = "https://www.adobe.com/"><span id = "adobe">Adobe</span></a> as a product design intern on the Lightroom team, where I had the incredible opportunity to design for the future of their onboarding and home experiences (as well as work on a couple other side projects while I was there). I'm really excited say that I'll be joining <a class ="link" href = "https://facebook.design/"><span id = "f">Facebook</span></a> as a product design intern this summer!

			<br /><br />

			Ever since I serendipitously took the <a class ="link" href = "https://berkeleyinnovation.org/decal"><span id = "bi">human-centered design decal</span></a> fall of my first year (run by Berkeley Innovation, go take it!), I’ve been deeply passionate about problem-solving and design thinking.
			I am fascinated by the intersection of art and technology, and how this combination can be used to create delightful, meaningful experiences. When I’m not designing or sleeping, you can probably find me eating Thai food, skating to class, listening to 99 Percent Invisible, or coding up a new version of this website.
