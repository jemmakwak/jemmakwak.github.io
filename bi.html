<!-- Hey you! Thanks for stopping by. Everything you see here was coded by me personally. None of this is built on wordpress, wix, webflow, squarespace, etc.

Hopefully you're just browsing around for fun, but I want to let you know that my work has been plagiarized... quite a bit recently. It makes me super sad and I hope those are not your intentions, but if you're here to copy code, please think twice about it. Is it really worth it to take someone's hard work and online brand to try to get a leg up? Thanks for reading, and I hope you understand the implications of your actions on others.

					Olark
 is a live chat software system aimed at making businesses human again by supporting their client’s live chats with sales, marketing, and customer support.
				</div>
				Through Berkeley Innovation in the Spring 2018 semester, I worked on a redesign of Olark's internal employee feedback system. I worked with David Aguilar, Kirra Dickinson, and Erika Jin on this project. We were mentored by Kathleen Hsu.
				<br /><br />
				Our team collaborated with Olark’s Director of People Ops and Director of Product Design to redesign their entirely remote feedback evaluation system.

					The Problem
				</div>
				Previously, the evaluation process occured on an annual basis. Their Google Form format was reported to be lengthy, tedious, and cumbersome. In a remote-first work setting, how do employees accurately gauge their work performance from their team members and manager?

				<div class = "bold header">
					Opportunity Areas
				</div>
				The scope of the project was to explore the needs of Olark employees in order to design an evaluation system that would elicit constructive feedback in a seamless manner. Areas we wanted to investigate: frequency of feedback, appropriate and engaging questions, and medium for giving and receiving feedback.

					We conducted extensive research in order to better understand the experiences and needs of Olark’s employees by engaging in a variety of research methods:

				<div class = "bold ">
					Desktop Research
				</div>
				We familiarized ourselves with best practices regarding feedback design. We explored systems of feedback from other remote-based companies.

				<div class = "bold">
					Internal Interviews
				</div>
				 We conducted internal interviews with 12 Olark employees to better understand their experiences within the company and filling out evaluations.

				 <div class = "bold">
 					External Interviews
 				</div>
				To gain further insights into remote working conditions, we interviewed three employees from different remote companies.

					Key Insights
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Olark’s company culture can sometimes feel overly positive, which hinders the ability to receive actionable, constructive feedback.
					</li>
					<li>
						Due to the evaluation’s annual timing, peers don’t often know what to comment in addition to running into recency bias.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class = "bold">
					User Pain Points
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Difficult to give feedback to peers outside of this annual evaluation form.
					</li>
					<li>
						Process of consolidating feedback for managers is heavy-weight and time-consuming.
					</li>
					<li>
						Many Olarkers do not reflect upon their feedback and lack actionable next steps to implement growth opportunity areas.

							Usability Testing
						</div>
						<div class = "bold">
							Throughout usability testing, a few key roadblocks became apparent:e
						</div>
						<div class = "bold">
							Unclear Expectations
						</div>
						Employees had trouble understanding why they had to complete an action. How was this relevant and how would it help them?
						<div class = "bold">
							Question Format
						</div>
						Our initial assumption was that Olarkers wanted solely free response questions. However, we learned that this was hard to quantify when compiling the data or looking at trends over time.
						<div class = "bold">
							Confusing Use Cases
						</div>
						We initially dedicated a huge portion of our prototype to a concept that incorporated meeting agendas with user goals. However, as we progressed through our user testing, we quickly saw that this format of combining user goals with meeting agendas didn't make much sense to Olarkers, so we had to scrap this idea. We ended up deciding to keep the goals accessible and personalizable to users.
						<div class = "bold">
							We used this feedback to quickly pivot in the right direction and continued iterating on our designs.

									Designing as a Team
								</div>
								Prior to joining BI, almost all of my design projects had been self-directed. The majority of my work was done by myself. It was a challenging transition to designing within a group setting. I definitely learned how to better take criticism and iterate as a team with multiple perspectives and stakeholders.

										Acknowledgements
									</div>
									This project was in collaboration with Berkeley students David Aguilar, Kirra Dickinson, and Erika Jin. Thank you to our wonderful mentor, Kathleen Hsu! Additionally, a huge thank you to the incredibly positive and warm folks at Olark for their constant support and feedback throughout our design process. This was my very first semester in Berkeley Innovation, and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to learn and grow as a designer.
