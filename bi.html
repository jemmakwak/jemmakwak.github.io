			Introduction
		</div>
		<div class = "project-text">
			Through Berkeley Innovation in the Spring 2018 semester,
			I worked on a redesign of Olark's internal employee feedback system.
			I worked with

				David Aguilar
				<div class = "underline underline-blue"></div>
			</a>,
			<a class = "blue" href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirradickinson/">

			</a>, and
			<a class = "blue" href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikajin/">
				Erika Jin
				<div class = "underline underline-blue"></div>
			</a>  on this project. We were mentored by
			<a class = "blue" href = "https://kathleenhsu.com/">
				Kathleen Hsu
				<div class = "underline underline-blue"></div>
			</a>.

			<a class = "blue" href = "https://olark.com/">
				Olark
				<div class = "underline underline-blue"></div>
			</a> is a live chat software system aimed at making businesses human again by supporting
			their client’s live chats with sales, marketing, and customer support. The caveat?
			They all work remotely! Our team collaborated with Olark’s Director of People Ops and Director
			of Product Design to redesign their feedback evaluation system.
			 <div class = "header">
	 			The Problem
	 		</div>
			Previously, the evaluation process occured on an annual basis.
			Their Google Form format was reported to be lengthy, tedious, and cumbersome.
			In a remote-first work setting, <span class = "strong">how do employees accurately gauge their work performance from their team members and manager? </span>
			<div class = "header">
			 Opportunity Areas
		 </div>
		 The scope of the project was to explore the needs of Olark employees in order
		  to design an evaluation system that would elicit constructive feedback in a seamless manner.
			 Areas we wanted to investigate: frequency of feedback, questions to include, and medium for giving and receiving feedback.
			 <div class = "header">
 			 User Research
 		 </div>
		 We conducted extensive research in order to better understand the experiences and needs of
		 Olark’s employees by engaging in a variety of research methods:
		 <ol>
			<li>
				<div class = "strong">Desktop Research</div> - We familiarized ourselves with best practices
				regarding feedback design. We explored systems of feedback from other remote-based companies.
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class = "strong">Internal Interviews</div> - We conducted internal interviews with 12 Olark employees to
				better understand their experiences within the company and filling out evaluations.
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class = "strong">External Interviews</div> 	- To gain further insights into remote working conditions,
				we interviewed three employees from different remote companies.
			</li>
		 </ol>

			</div>
		</div>

		 <div class = "header">Research Insights</div>
		 <div class = "strong">Key Insights</div>
		 <ul>
			<li>
				Olark’s company culture can sometimes feel overly positive, which hinders the ability to receive actionable, constructive feedback.
			</li>
			<li>
				Due to the evaluation’s annual timing, peers don’t often know what to comment in addition to running into recency bias.
			</li>
		 </ul>

		 <div class = "strong">User Pain Points</div>
		 <ul>
			<li>
				Difficult to give feedback to peers outside of this annual evaluation form.
			</li>
			<li>
				Process of consolidating feedback for managers is heavy-weight and time-consuming.
			</li>
			<li>
				Many Olarkers do not reflect upon their feedback and lack actionable next steps to implement growth opportunity areas.
			</li>
		 </ul>

	 <div class = "header">Identifying Key User Needs</div>
			 We then identified three key needs of Olark employees that we wanted to make sure to address in our solution.

			 <ol>
				<li>
					<span class = "strong">Achievement</span> - Olarkers need to feel accomplished and look back at the end of the day and be proud of and happy with their work.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class = "strong">Progress + Personal Development</span> - Olarkers want to know that they’re improving as employees and are on the right track for what’s next.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class = "strong">Affiliation</span> - Olarkers thrive on a sense of belonging to the company and others.
				</li>
			 </ol>

			 <div class = "header">Defining User Personas</div>
			 <div class = "page-image">
				<img src = "assets/img/bi/personas.png">
				<div class = "grid-caption">
					Three consolidated user personas.
				</div>
			</div>
				<div class = "header">Journey Mapping</div>
				In order to best design for the needs of multiple employees, we created a journey map to
				visualize the feedback journey from start to finish. We noted the actions employees might take,
				emotions that might arise, and pain points.

			<div class = "strong">Initial Ideas</div>
				<ul>
					<li>

					</li>
					<li>
						Channels to promote frequent feedback
					</li>
					<li>

			<div class = "strong">Objective</div>
			Create a dashboard for Olarks evaluation system that would address their three key needs
			<div class = "strong">Goals</div>

		 <div class = "header">
				Usability Testing
		</div>
		Throughout usability testing, a few key roadblocks became apparent:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<div class = "strong">Unclear Expectations</div>Employees had trouble understanding why they had to complete an action. How was this relevant and how would it help them?
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class = "strong">Question Format</div>Our initial assumption was that Olarkers wanted solely
				free response questions. However, we learned that this was hard to quantify when compiling the data or looking at trends over time.

			</li>
			<li>
				<div class = "strong">Confusing Use Cases</div>
				We initially dedicated a huge portion of our prototype to a concept that incorporated meeting agendas with user goals. However, as we
				progressed through our user testing, we quickly saw that this format of combining user goals with meeting agendas didn't make
				much sense to Olarkers, so we had to scrap this idea. We ended up deciding to keep the goals accessible and personalizable to users.
			</li>
		</ul>
		We used this feedback to quickly pivot in the right direction and continued iterating on our designs.

		Designing as a Team
	 </div>
	 Prior to joining BI, all of my design projects had been self-directed. The majority of my work was done by myself. It was a challenging transition to designing within a group setting. I definitely learned how to better take criticism and iterate as a team with multiple views and stakeholders.

			 	Acknowledgements
		 </div>
		 This project was in collaboration with Berkeley students David Aguilar, Kirra Dickinson, and Erika Jin. Thank you to our
		 wonderful mentor, Kathleen Hsu! Additionally, a huge thank you to the incredibly positive and warm folks at Olark for their
		 constant support and feedback throughout our design process. This was my very first semester in
		 Berkeley Innovation,
		 and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to learn and grow as a designer.
