				Piazza
				<div class = "underline underline-blue"></div>
			</a>
			is an online discussion and Q&amp;A forum used by schools.
				 Classes at UC Berkeley use Piazza as the main mode of communication between students and
				 instructors. Students use the platform to ask questions about topics ranging anywhere from
				 course material to general course logistics, to declarations of gratitude and happiness at
					3am after finishing a particularly difficult project(See
				 <a href = "assets/img/piazza/lol.png" class = "blue">gitlet
					 <div class = "underline underline-blue">

					 </div>

	 			As someone who has used Piazza as a student and instructor, I understood many of the usability issues and disappointing user interface from both ends. One of the key features that make Piazza so useful is its ability to make the classroom feel smaller by connecting students directly with the teaching staff. For students enrolled in huge classes at Berkeley(professors have asked for students not to come to physical lecture and, instead, watch online webcast videos), Piazza is a refuge where both parties—students and teachers—get to ask and answer questions on their own time. Unfortunately, the organization of the application is confusing, jumbled, and frustrating to use.
	 			<br><br>

			 </div>
	 			After conducting user research on the current use of the app, I concluded that
	 			the biggest areas for improvement would be the organization of posts, flow of answering
	 			questions(particularly in threads), emphasis of existing key features, and the sense of a classroom feeling.
	 		 <br><br>
	 		 I also saw a huge opportunity to give the user interface a much-needed facelift
	 		 that could bring Piazza into the present with a modern look and feel.

			 After some user research, I consolidated the main pain points I felt necessary to address with the redesign.

			 <div class = "four-grid">
				 <div class = "grid-item">
					<div class = "grid-header">
						<i class="fa fa-folder-open socials"></i> Categorization of Posts
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						There is currently no organization
						to the mass amount of questions. Students must
						be exact when searching for a post that can often be buried during high traffic times, such
						as project and homework deadlines.
					</div>
				 </div>

				 <div class = "grid-item">
					<div class = "grid-header">
						<i class="fa fa-thumbs-up socials"></i> Validation Metric
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						 One of the current action items for a user is to “Good Question” or “Good Note” a post.
						 I decided to generalize the system into “likes.”
						  The “Most Popular” posts are intuitively the ones with the most likes.
					</div>
				 </div>

				 <div class = "grid-item">
					<div class = "grid-header">
						<i class="fa fa-smile-o socials"></i> Classroom Feeling
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						Piazza's current design does not lend itself
		 			 to an incredibly social environment. I hoped in emphasizing both students’ and teachers’
		 			  identities would a more social, relaxed
		 				user experience for all parties.
					</div>
				 </div>

				 <div class = "grid-item">
					<div class = "grid-header">
						<i class="fa fa-sitemap socials"></i> Organization of Threads
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						Many questions turn into lengthy discussions with the “Followup” feature.
		 			 With the feature of anonymity in followups, it is unclear who is talking to who when the threads become long, despite
						the importance of the feature.

		This was my first serious mobile redesign. If I were to do things differently,
		I would have definitely started with a style guide. I had been unfamiliar with the grid system
		at the time and did not incorporate specific step sizes into my designs.

		<br><br>

		Additionally, I didn't utilize the Assets palette in Adobe Xd, which made any necessary changes
		to a single, repeated component very tedious.

		<br><br>

		Piazza is truthfully one of the most utilized, free tools at Berkeley. By improving
		the accessibility and usability of such an important academic resource, we can improve
		the overall experience for both the student and the instructors.

		I truly hope Piazza is able to see the importance of user flow, a and ultimately,
		 move the application in the direction where students feel excited to use it.
