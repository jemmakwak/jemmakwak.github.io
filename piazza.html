					Piazza is an online discussion and Q&A forum used by schools, specifically by STEM classes in universities.

					The Problem
				</div>
				As someone who has used Piazza as a student and instructor, I understood many of the usability issues and disappointing user interface from both ends.
				<br /><br />

				 One of the key features that make Piazza so useful is its ability to make the classroom feel smaller by connecting students directly with the teaching staff. For students enrolled in huge classes at Berkeley(professors have asked for students not to come to physical lecture and, instead, watch online webcast videos), Piazza is a refuge where both parties—students and teachers—get to ask and answer questions on their own time. Unfortunately, the organization of the application is confusing, jumbled, and frustrating to use.

				After conducting user research on the current use of the app, I concluded that the biggest areas for improvement would be the organization of posts, flow of answering questions(particularly in threads), emphasis of existing key features, and the sense of a classroom feeling.
				<br /><br />
				I also saw a huge opportunity to give the user interface a much-needed facelift that could bring Piazza into the present with a modern look and feel.

					Design Goals
				</div>
					<div class = "bold">Categorization of Posts</div>
					There is currently no organization to the mass amount of questions. Students must be exact when searching for a post that can often be buried during high traffic times, such as project and homework deadlines.
					<div class = "bold">Validation Metric</div>
					One of the current action items for a user is to “Good Question” or “Good Note” a post. I decided to generalize the system into “likes.” The “Most Popular” posts are intuitively the ones with the most likes.
					<div class = "bold">Classroom Feeling</div>
					Piazza's current design does not lend itself to an incredibly social environment. I hoped in emphasizing both students’ and teachers’ identities would a more social, relaxed user experience for all parties.
					<div class = "bold">Thread Organization</div>
					Many questions turn into lengthy discussions with the “Followup” feature. With the feature of anonymity in followups, it is unclear who is talking to who when the threads become long, despite the importance of the feature.

					Reflection
				</div>
				Piazza is truthfully one of the most utilized, free tools at Berkeley. By improving the accessibility and usability of such an important academic resource, we can improve the overall experience for both the student and the instructors. I truly hope Piazza is able to see the importance of user flow, and ultimately, move the application in the direction where students feel excited to use it.
