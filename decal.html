				<a class = "text-links" href = "https://decal.berkeley.edu/">Democratic Education at Cal</a>, better known as DeCal, has served as an alternative to traditional coursework at Cal. The program provides students “unorthodox” course content to earn units and learn material that might not be offered in a traditional college course setting. 
				With over 130 courses approved, the growing number and increasingly diverse manner of these courses makes it very difficult for students to look for specific interests. There is very little indication of a DeCal’s measure of student reflection.

			<div class = "header"> User Research </div>

			<div class = project-p>
				The priority when conducting user research was to understand what made the students’ interaction with the DeCal interface both easy and difficult. What parts of it did they appreciate about the old site and current beta release? What features matter the most to students -- scheduling, number of units, ability to quickly sort through courses? How do students make the choice to choose certain courses?

				<em>Features to be added/improved upon</em>
				<ul>
					<li>Color scheme to be more coherent and connected</li>
					<li>For DeCals with many applications, let students directly apply from the course page</li>
					<li>Organize the DeCal interest page by application deadlines/due dates by urgency</li>
					<li>Filter page should be iterated upon. What does it look like when clicked on? How specific are the features?</li>
					<li>Potentially add social-media functionality</li>
				</ul>

				<em>Well-received features</em>
				<ul>
					<li>Ability to filter through more options(time and category being amongst the most popular filters)</li>
					<li>Onboarding was recieved well for simplicity and conciseness</li>
					<li>Visuals and course pictures added personality and made course selection more personable and fun</li>
					<li>Reviews feature was helpful</li>

			<div class = "project-p"> 
				This was my first in-depth case study to completely reimagine an application. I took this project to familiarize myself with Adobe Experience Design and learn how to use Adobe tools to produce .

				<br>
				<br>

				If I were to do this project differently, I would have spent more time iterating on low and mid-fidelity prototypes to avoid having to flesh out important features when creating the final product look, which proved to be time-consuming and taxing. Additionally, I would have spent time producing a style guide to create a cohesive visual theme.
