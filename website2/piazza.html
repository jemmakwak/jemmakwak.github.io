				Piazza
				<div class = "underline underline-blue"></div>
			</a>
			is an online discussion and Q&amp;A forum used by schools.
				 Classes at UC Berkeley use Piazza as the main mode of communication between students and
				 instructors. Students use the platform to ask questions about topics ranging anywhere from
				 course material to general course logistics, to declarations of gratitude and happiness at
					3am after finishing a particularly difficult project(See
				 <a href = "assets/img/lol.png">gitlet</a>).

	 			</div>
	 			As someone who has used Piazza as a student and instructor, I understood many of the usability issues and disappointing user interface from both ends. One of the key features that make Piazza so useful is its ability to make the classroom feel smaller by connecting students directly with the teaching staff. For students enrolled in huge classes at Berkeley(professors have asked for students not to come to physical lecture and, instead, watch online webcast videos), Piazza is a refuge where both parties—students and teachers—get to ask and answer questions on their own time. Unfortunately, the organization of the application is confusing, jumbled, and frustrating to use.
	 			<br><br>
	 			After conducting user research on the current use of the app, I concluded that
	 			the biggest areas for improvement would be the organization of posts, flow of answering
	 			questions(particularly in threads), emphasis of existing key features, and the sense of a classroom feeling.
	 		 <br><br>
	 		 I also saw a huge opportunity to give the user interface a much-needed facelift
	 		 that could bring Piazza into the present with a modern look and feel.

						Categorization of Posts
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						There is currently no organization
						to the mass amount of questions(hundreds usually, all regarding vastly different topics)
						and minimal distinction of posts made by student vs. teaching staff. Students must
						be exact when searching for a post that can often be buried during high traffic times, such
						as project and homework deadlines or midterm season.

						Validation Metric
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						 One of the current action items for a user is to “Good Question” or “Good Note” a post.
						 There is currently no way to see the number of “Good”’’s a post has received or what posts
						 have received higher measures of these metrics, so I decided to generalize the system into “likes.”
						  The “Most Popular” posts are intuitively the ones with the most likes.

						Classroom Feeling
					</div>
					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						Piazza does a wonderful job of connecting students in a class
		 			 that might otherwise feel difficult to navigate. The current design does not lend itself
		 			 to an incredibly social environment. I hoped in emphasizing both students’ and teachers’
		 			  identities would a more social, relaxed
		 				user experience for all parties.

					<div class = "grid-item-description">
						Many questions turn into lengthy discussions with the “Followup” feature.
		 			 With the feature of anonymity in followups, it is unclear who is talking to who when the threads become long.
		 			  At the same time, anonymity is an important feature for students to feel more comfortable asking questions
